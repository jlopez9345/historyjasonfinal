        <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
        <p>The origins of computing can be traced back to ancient tools such as the abacus, used to perform basic arithmetic operations. Invented thousands of years ago, the abacus is often considered the first computing device. During the 17th century, mechanical calculators like Blaise Pascal's Pascaline advanced the field of computation by automating mathematical tasks. These devices, though primitive, laid the groundwork for future inventions. By the 19th century, Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine introduced the concept of programmable machines. Although never fully realized during his lifetime, Babbage's vision was a significant leap toward modern computers.</p>

        <h2>The 20th Century</h2>
        <p>The 20th century marked the emergence of electronic computing, beginning with machines like the ENIAC in the 1940s. ENIAC, one of the earliest electronic general-purpose computers, was used for military calculations during World War II. Its design incorporated thousands of vacuum tubes and occupied an entire room. In the 1950s, the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors made computers more efficient and compact. This era also saw the development of mainframe computers, used primarily by businesses and governments. These innovations set the stage for the computer revolution that followed.</p>

        <h2>The Modern Era</h2>
        <p>The late 20th century witnessed the advent of personal computers, bringing technology to households around the globe. Innovations by companies like Apple and Microsoft made computing accessible to ordinary users. The invention of the internet further transformed computers into essential tools for communication and information. Modern computers are now embedded in nearly every aspect of our lives, from smartphones to smart homes. Todayâ€™s devices are exponentially more powerful and efficient than their predecessors. The ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence and quantum computing promise to shape the future of technology even further.</p>
